<!-- ## About Me -->

<!-- ![ROhan](/rohan.jpeg) -->

{{< figure class="avatar" src="/rohan.jpeg" alt="avatar">}}

Hello! My name is [Rohan Mittal](https://github.com/rohanmittal73) and I enjoy creating things that live on the internet. 

I work at the intersection of curiosity, reasoning and imagination, which guide me to uncover insights, (re)frame problems and craft meaningful, future-oriented solutions. I am passionate about deep learning and natural language especially for spoken language processing, language modeling, and representation learning.

Fast-forward to today, I’ve had the privilege of working at a [start-up](https://www.roostify.com/) on automating a bank-transaction category identification task using transformer based models trained on the transaction description text.

I also recently appointed as a Grader at [UMass Amherst](https://www.umass.edu/) for COMPSCI 589 (Machine Learning).

If you ever want to connect hit me up on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rohan73/). To collaborate here’s my [GitHub](https://github.com/rohanmittal73) or you can drop me an email at rohanmittal [AT] umass [DOT] edu.
